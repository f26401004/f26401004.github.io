      "description": "<p>In this project, I first containerized the MEC kernel module (involving GPRS Tunnelling Protocol module and forwarding module), making network administrator easier to deploy the MEC kernel as either a Docker container or Helm Chart to their environment. Secondly, I&nbsp;established the experiment environment with three machines acting as LTE EPC (Evolved Packet Core), UE(User Equipment), and MEC in 4G LTE, which involves NextEPC installation and configuration, packet routing using iptables and arp, and microk8s installation and configuration. On top of that, I packaged layer-4 and layer-7 load balancing to the MEC platform with External-DNS, enabling end-users to use annotation declaration to configure external DNS servers (AWS Route53, Google CloudDNS, and others) for Kubernetes Ingresses and Services. Finally, I experimented with many features provided by the Rancher, the open-source multi-cluster orchestration platform, including continuous integration and delivery, health and readiness probe, basic operation and configuration on a service and ingress in the Kubernetes.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Acted as full-stack engineer, I designed and built core for games including collecting resources, mining, offline countdown timer, etc. In addition, I constructed several back-end APIs including collect resource system, email system using Express.js, DynamoDB, AWS Lambda. Apart from the game mechanism,  I developed effective solutions across Android and iOS platforms. In 2020, I led the development of integration between web app and mobile app and was responsible for successfully migrating all development modules from our web-based application to a one-codebase hybrid mobile app, significantly reducing the development process. On top of that, I am attentive to the need for continuous process improvements. I proposed an automated mobile deployment flow taking advantage of containers to reduce the delivery cycle, which resulted in an average of 50% reduction in hours between project kickoff and production launch. </p>",

      "description": "<p>In this project, acted as a project leader, I lead the 6-person team to develop an online judge platform to evaluate 300+ students&#39; performance in Program Design (I) course 2020. The project mainly includes platform construction and evaluation security. For the platform construction, we adopted Vue.js as a frontend framework to build our website. Furthermore, we applied a state management pattern using Vuex, a centralized store for all the components in an application, which is with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. Finally, we developed a content management system (CMS) with CRUD Web APIs for coding problem management. As for evaluation security, we sandboxed the process with the Linux system call filtering, namespace isolation, and discretionary access control to prevent users from escalating their privilege and accessing unauthorized resources. We also restricted the memory usage for each evaluation process and scaled the number of the service when under high traffic.</p>",
